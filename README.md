Twitter Sentiment Analysis of the Automotive Sector - To understand the change in customer perception post-Covid
Purpose
The study was conducted to perform and present a competitive market analysis, for our client,  to reflect the changes in consumer perception and buying behaviour post COVID-19 in India for the following motorcycle brands:
Bajaj Autos 
Eicher Motors 
Hero MotoCorp 
Honda Motorcycles 
TVS Motors
Suzuki Motors 

Approach
Social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube and other online platforms were scraped to gather and consolidate public reviews about each brand. We have divided the data scrapped from twitter into - official tweets and general tweets, based on the twitter characteristics. The idea behind the categorisation was to understand the official messaging vis-à-vis the general public sentiment.

Challenge 
We went about understanding the sentiment and the priorities of the customers and how it has changed over the period from pre-covid till now. In order to do that the data was collected from Twitter for each assigned brands. The data was scraped using the most appropriate guided techniques to ensure that only the data pertaining to the brand (official and verified accounts) are captured.
The relevance of the Twitter data was stark and incomprehensible. One of the reason being the vagueness of the information and the lack of specificity (as we were looking at the overall brand in general). Thus even after performing the hashtag analysis or topic modelling we weren’t able to draw a conclusive theme from the data.
Solution and Highlights
In order to overcome this issue, we decided to take a two-phase approach, which involved a Hashtag Analysis of the Official Tweets and Public sentiment analysis over the period (for the rest of the tweets). This was helpful in understanding the official messaging and how the public sentiments varied over the target period. We observed the following conclusive findings related to the brands:
Market position of Hero, Honda, Bajaj, and Honda did not change due to COVID. Although Royal Enfield’s and Suzuki’s market position has relatively gone back and forth, it remained well below other major brands. We anticipate similar trends continuing for the next three months. 
The market campaigning of some of the brands were aligned with public sentiments as projected in our analysis. The brands that were quick to adopt public perception also witnessed increased volume in sales – Gixxer (Suzuki); Hornet (Honda); Xpulse (Hero).
Majority of the brands have outperformed their previous year sales since September 2020. It is interesting to note that September has also been the month when the tweet volume for most brands reached pre-covid levels.
